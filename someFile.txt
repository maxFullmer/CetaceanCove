    You've just told your computer that you want git to watch the `myProject` folder and to keep track of any changes. This also allows us to run git commands inside of the folder. (Warning:  Be very careful to make sure you're in the right directory when you run `git init`!)

* Run `git remote add origin [Repository URL goes here]`. You can get your URL from going to repository you made earlier in your browser and copying the address.

    Basically, we tell our computer "Hey, I created this repo on GitHub, so when I push, I want my code to go to this GitHub repo." Now whenever you run `git push origin master` your computer knows that origin is pointing to your repo you made on GitHub and it pushes your changes there.

    <br />

    ( If you accidentally DID initialize your repository with a README, you must do a `git pull origin master` first - to get the README file on your computer - before you'll be able to push. )
